            <p id="paragraph2">Chill day overall. Woke up to see Ramana mama was not coming and went to sleep for 
                5 mins which turned into 2hrs LOL Got up and took time to shave everything today. 
                Feels like I dropped 4/5 years in age! Cooked and ate lunch. Lunch special was opening up the season's new mango pickle.
                I got ready and went to campus for the NASA meeting. Just tried to work from lab, but realized internet is slower so came home. 
                Worked for a bit on HY and research stuff. Then at 5, called Kavya for a bit and then went to my first job session. 
                Today session was: 5 min walk (1min run 1.5 min walk)*8 and 5 min cool down walk. Came home, amma called to show puja at new apartment in Vijayawada.
                Then showered and got a suprise call from PANDO! It feels soo nice to see the smile! Immediately after the call, joined Sankalp Checkin and Security team call.
                Went to eat dinner. After dinner, watched a movie (Bharatiyudu 2) while doing some small works. Followed up with kishores. Talked to Nanna for an hour.
                Wasted time for a bit and wrapping up by changing the website.
